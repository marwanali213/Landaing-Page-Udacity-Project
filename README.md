#The Landing Project!
>The project is about minipulating the dom and i have learned TONS of new information !!! this has gotta be the most informative part of a course!
I have added a Responsive Navigation Bar and i have learnt how active class works and highlighting .
## Table of Contents
*  I edited in the css content cause I needed it.
* Responsive Navigation Bar , you can click it to go to a specific section , and you will go to this section.
* It's Responsive , easy to use , pretty.


## Room for Improvement
I need a review of the way I write code because I feel it's not good to practice somewhere, and I may have misunderstood things about the project requirements, but I did my best to be appropriate, and I understood the parts I need to practice more and the parts I'm good at, I'm waiting for your review.
